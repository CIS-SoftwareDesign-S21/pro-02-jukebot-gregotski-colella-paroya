# Vision
For Discord users who want to listen to music in a channel within a server with other Discord members so that everyone can synchronously listen to the same song. The JukeBot is a Discord music bot that the user can add to their channel to play music within the group chat that delivers excellent sound quality unlike playing music aloud in another open tab that relies on a userâ€™s microphone. Our product enables Discord users to play from a variety of music services to share music in a group environment that creates a similar ambiance of playing music with a stereo in person, but in an online setting.
