# Vision
For Discord users who want to listen to music in a channel within a server with other Discord members so that everyone can synchronously listen to the same song. The JukeBot is a Discord music bot that the user can add to their channel to play music within the group chat that delivers excellent sound quality unlike playing music aloud in another open tab that relies on a userâ€™s microphone. Our product enables Discord users to play from a variety of music services to share music in a group environment that creates a similar ambiance of playing music with a stereo in person, but in an online setting.
# Personas
Persona #1:

Matt, age 20, is a student at Temple University who lives on campus and has friends who attend the same college, but commute from home instead. They communicate with each other through Discord to collaborate on a group project for their marketing class in the Fox School of Business. The objective of this project is to create an advertisement for the new Temple footwear.

One of the requirements for the project is to decide which song to play in the background of the video for their advertisement. Since Matt and his friends are college students, they do not have as much money since they are currently unemployed, so they do not want to subscribe to  Spotify music or any other music streaming service. They are interested in adding the JukeBot to their Discord channel to discuss which song, with YouTube as a source, to select for their project. They also find it convenient that this product states the artist and song without any confusion on what kind of version it is when searching it on their own.
